notes:
- shared memory will only be faster than udp when there is a lot of data (mbs, gbs)
- udp can be faster with zero-copy networking

These numbers assume each pixel is 3 bytes (w x h x 3)
- 720 x 480 is 1,036,800 bytes or 1.03 mb
- 1080 x 1920 is 6,220,800 bytes or 6.22 mb
- 4096 x 2160 is 26,542,080 bytes or 26.5 mb
- 7680 x 4320 is 99,532,800 bytes or 99.5 mb
- 15360 × 8640 is 398,131,200 bytes or 398 mb
